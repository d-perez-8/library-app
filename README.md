## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript, NodeJS, Express, EJS, MongoDB, CSS, Bootstrap, Passport.js

In this project, I wanted to create a full stack web application using EJS for the front end templating and NodeJS as my backend enviornment with help from Express. The desgin structure follows the MVC paradigm including a routes folder. This application uses MongoDB as the database where it holds the data for users, their books, and thier login session. 

For styling, I used a little CSS for marking whether the user has finished reading the book or not. I also used Bootstap to help the site look more presentable by easily adding styles to buttons, forms, and main library content.

I used serveral middleware to help improve this project including express, mongoose, passport, flash and morgan. 

## Optimizations

I have made some optimizations with subbting data to MongoDB. I started to use mongoose to help the readability and it made the development process easier and faster. Also, using EJS as a templeting language makes the web application more interactive. It follows the same rules as HTML, but it let you include Javascipt script directly in it.

## Lessons Learned:

This project has taught me that development time for full stack web development takes a while. Keeping notes on the variables I have used, made it easier for me to reference those variables from other files. While useing the MVC, It  helps to breakdown each task and how you will need to connect with other parts of the MVC. It was great to learn how and why the MVC works for developers. If I had an issue, I knew where to go to solve it.
